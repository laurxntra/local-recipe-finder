**Bad Things Our Peers Mentioned (Group 8)**
- Rotation 
  - They mentioned that horizontally rotating the phone results in the app becoming unusable. However, we decided that it was not worth fixing because our app shouldn't ideally perform well when rotating because then the icon that needs to be swiped upon would be extremely small in order to fit the constraints of any phone that rotates horizontally. So, this was why we chose not to make these changes in our app.

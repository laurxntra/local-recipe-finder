# Audit Changes
## Here we list the good and bad things our peer auditors mentioned and our responses to that.

**Good Things Our Auditors Mentioned (Group 8)**
- Contrast is good
  - Group 8 mentioned that our contrast was great and appeared accessible to them because of their checks on the contrast checker they used, verifying that we did it correctly.
- Good font resizing
  - When Group 8 resized the screen, they mentioned that it was great to making it accessible and readable for others and that everything resized properly.

**Bad Things Our Auditors Mentioned (Group 8)**
- Rotation
  - They mentioned that horizontally rotating the phone results in the app becoming unusable. However, we decided that it was not worth fixing because our app shouldn't ideally perform well when rotating. This is because then the icon that needs to be swiped upon would be extremely small in order to fit the constraints of any phone that rotates horizontally. So, this was why we chose not to make these changes in our app. 
- Semantic Labels
  - They mentioned that the app doesn't perform that well with a screen reader because the semantic labels aren't set properly for all images/icons. We did decide to fix this, and made sure to go back and check all such images and buttons to make sure there are descriptive labels.

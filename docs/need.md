**Addressing a Human Need**  
- The need our app addresses is the fact that many people in the United States feel incapable of cooking with a lack of skills necessary to learn how to cook effectively and have the food they cook taste good. This can come from a variety of reasons, like a lack of confidence or unfamiliarity with cooking in general. We sought news stories to gather existing evidence to identify this issue since it seemed like a valid problem that people of all age ranges have, especially when they're first starting to live on their own, and we found that around 28% of Americans don't cook (https://www.delish.com/food/news/a38951/one-third-of-americans-do-not-know-how-to-cook/). Because of this, combined with the general input we received from our SUS testing after we implemented the application (which isn't considered as part of identifying the need, but rather supplements the reasoning for going forward with this human need after we had already decided on this application), we had confidence in approaching this problem with the solution we present by creating an application that focuses on helping people find recipes in an easy and fast manner, where they can feel confident in learning how to cook with the ingredients needed for every recipe and storing all of a user's saved recipes for later.

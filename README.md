# Starting Repo Structure
You should create a new flutter project (`flutter create -e <project name>`) *inside* the `code` directory.
Put your docs (except README) in the `docs` directory.

Once you start adding things to the `code` and `docs` directories, delete the files named `delete_this_file` from each of those directories, repectively. They are temporary placeholders, because git does not allow the addition of empty directories to a repo.

# Documentation
You should delete everything in this file, and replace what's here with the sections and details required by final project assignment specification.
